## What even is this?

Each machine in the network has an associated [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1) keypair. When a device wants to connect, it negotiates an [ECDHE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman) secret. This prevents any snooping from outside.

Once a connection is established, the devices form a gossip network, passing arbitrary messages between participants. These can be public (e.g. connection status), or private (e.g. a personal message). In the latter case, ECDH will be used to securely encrypt the contents.

## Why?

I wanted to mess around with cryptographic primitives. Also I wanted to make a cool, cypherpunk network.
